Why Cloud Computing?
Scalability: Cloud services can easily scale up or down based on demand, so you only pay for what you use.

Cost Efficiency: Cloud computing often reduces the need for significant upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure. You can pay for cloud resources on a subscription or usage-based model.

Accessibility: Cloud services are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, which enhances collaboration and remote work capabilities.

Disaster Recovery: Many cloud providers offer robust backup and disaster recovery solutions, reducing the risk of data loss.

Automatic Updates: Cloud providers handle software updates and maintenance, ensuring that you have the latest features and security patches.

Flexibility: You can choose from a wide range of services and tools to meet your specific needs, from computing power to storage to analytics.

What is the Cloud?
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Examples: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, often for application development. Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine.

Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. Examples: Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365.

Public Cloud: Services are delivered over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations. Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform.

Private Cloud: Cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization, offering more control and security. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.

Public Cloud
Definition: A public cloud is a type of cloud computing service where resources are provided over the internet by third-party providers. These resources include servers, storage, applications, and services. They are shared among multiple customers or organizations.

Key Characteristics:

Shared Resources: Public cloud resources are pooled and shared among multiple users or organizations, which helps in cost reduction.
Scalability: Public clouds offer high scalability, allowing users to quickly scale up or down based on their needs.
Accessibility: Resources and services are accessible over the internet from anywhere, making it ideal for remote work and global collaboration.
Cost-Effective: Users pay for what they use, often on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis, eliminating the need for significant upfront investments.
Managed Services: The cloud provider manages and maintains the infrastructure, including updates, security, and backup.
Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Use Cases:

Hosting websites and applications
Development and testing environments
Data storage and backup
High-performance computing
Private Cloud
Definition: A private cloud is a type of cloud computing service where the infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization. It can be hosted on-premises (within the organization's data centers) or by a third-party provider.

Key Characteristics:

Dedicated Resources: Resources are exclusive to one organization, offering higher levels of control, privacy, and security.
Customization: Private clouds can be tailored to the specific needs and requirements of an organization.
Compliance: Easier to meet regulatory and compliance requirements due to increased
Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
